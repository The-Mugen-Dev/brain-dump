### [twoSum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

```js
/*
Before coding:
   - only integer numbers? or negative values?

Approaches
   - Brute force:
  - Iterate over all element and create all two number permutation possible
  - Make the sum of the pair numbers
  - Go through the result and check against the target
   - Map solution
  - Check length of arr for possible break conditions:
   - if less than 2 nums solution is not possible
   - if 2 return as result, problem states that we have at least one result
  - Create a map with all the numbers in the array fast lookups
   - key: value of the array (we use the value to subtract the value and find out if this number  will sum up to our target)
   - value: index in the array (keep track of the index position to return it as the result)
  - Go again through each element
   - subtract from target your current number
   - check if the result of the subtraction is in our map
   - if true
  - Create a pair using our current index and the value in our map

*/
var twoSum = function(nums, target) {

    if(nums.length < 2) return false;
    if(nums.length === 2) return [0,1];

    const map = {};
    for(const numIndex in nums){
        map[nums[numIndex]] = numIndex;
    }

    for(const numIndex in nums){
        const num = nums[numIndex];
        const diff = target - num; //What number we need to sum in order to get to the target
        const indexOfDiff = map[diff]; //Get the index to make sure we don't use the same number twice
        if(map[diff] && indexOfDiff !== numIndex){
            return [numIndex,map[diff]]
        }
    }
};
